Puzzle Build


Assignment Requirements

In its current state, our puzzle game has at least a couple of bugs. You can drag and drop more than one puzzle piece into a drop zone - this shouldn’t happen. There should only be one piece in one drop zone at a time.

The second bug is the problem with pieces appearing in the drop zones on reset / choosing a new puzzle. Those should be removed / reparented back to the drag zone as well, so that the player has a fresh board to drop onto.

Solve these two problems. You can use the original drop function to solve the first problem, and another function for the second. Try experimenting with calling one function from another - you might not need to add any event handling to solve these issues, just extend the functionality.

Write out your plan FIRST. You can’t solve a problem - coding or otherwise - if you don’t understand what you need to do. Reason about the problem - think it through. Articulating the solution first will be a great help in completing the assignment successfully.

Additional Requirements

1. Include a written plan / path with your submission. Analyze the problem and provide the solution. 2. Create a Readme.md document for the repo with detailed information about the project.
3. Create a branch for each bug and its solution. Provide the JS for each.
4. Merge everything to the master branch (keep all branches in your repo).
